# MRConnectingGestures

This project was the result of our partitipation in the Mixed Reality Course in the Fall Semester 2021.

Our Mixed Reality application enables the sculpting of geometries using the user’s hands directly onsite. Various digital tools that enable the design of custom
geometry rely on keyboard and mouse input, which can be non-intuitive for creative work. Artists are often used to working with their hands and in direct relation with the surrounding environment. In response to that, we use the HoloLens2 device to enable an intuitive digital sculpting process. Our investigations are assembled in this Unity application called ’Sculpting Gestures’, which was presented and tested by various users on the Demo day of the Mixed-Reality course.
